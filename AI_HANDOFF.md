# REALTRAIL — AI_HANDOFF.md

## 1. Project

**Realtrail** is an AI-assisted estate operations control center.

# 2. Source of truth

Read in this order:

1. `PROJECT_SPEC.md`
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
4. `AGENTS.md`
5. this file

Do not redesign the product from scratch.

Hosting:
- Convex static hosting;
- public `convex.site` URL for hackathon.

# 5. Case states

```text

Negative confirmation:
`AWAITING_CONFIRMATION → WORK_IN_PROGRESS`

Reopen:
`CLOSED → IN_PROGRESS`

# 6. Current phase

At the beginning of implementation:

**Phase 0 — Repository Reconnaissance**

No application implementation should begin until the agent has:
- inspected repository;
- reviewed docs;
- reported current structure and conflicts.

---

# 7. Completed work

At project creation:

- product definition complete;
- MVP scope complete;
- user roles complete;
- case lifecycle complete;
- data model complete;
- architecture complete;
- security architecture complete;
- UI/UX structure complete;
- integration architecture complete;
- phased implementation plan complete.

Application implementation:
- not started.

---

# 8. Known decisions

Fixed:

- Convex backend;
- React/Vite frontend;
- Clerk auth;
- AgentMail;
- OpenAI;
- Firecrawl;
- Convex Scheduler;
- no separate API server;
- no Postgres;
- no Redis;
- no payments;
- no resident/vendor portals in MVP;
- no autonomous case closure.

---

# 9. Important files

```text
PROJECT_SPEC.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
AGENTS.md
AI_HANDOFF.md
hackathon.md
```

Recommended application structure:

```text
src/
convex/
tests/
docs/
```

---

# 10. Verification commands

Expected commands:

```text
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:once
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

The exact script names may be established in Phase 1.

---

# 11. Known risk areas

Watch especially:

- workspace isolation;
- AgentMail duplicate webhook delivery;
- public confirmation token replay;
- AI prompt injection;
- vendor email send uncertainty;
- state transition races;
- cross-workspace property/unit IDs;
- accidentally exposing private email content;
- accidentally exposing provider API keys;
- rendering untrusted email HTML.

---

# 12. Hackathon state

The current official Convex All Gas page states:

- submissions: September 22, 2026 at 12:00 PM PT;
- public repo required;
- root `hackathon.md` required;
- public live app URL required;
- three-minute video required;
- `convex.site` or `chatgpt.site` is the stated public hosting target.

Verify the official page immediately before final submission in case requirements change. 

**Scope decision:** The hackathon deadline risk has been explicitly accepted. The project proceeds at full MVP scope per IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. A partial submission at the deadline is acceptable; the full plan is not compressed.

---

# 13. Next exact task

**Phase 0 — Repository Reconnaissance**

Agent must:
- inspect existing repository;
- identify existing stack;
- identify existing Convex configuration;
- identify existing files/components;
- compare against architecture;
- report conflicts;
- make no application changes.

STOP after reporting.
